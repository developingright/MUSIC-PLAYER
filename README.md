This project is a music app which is very easy to use, made using Tkinter and Pygame.
To start using this app, the user first has to add a song to queue by either selecting
the option of “Add a song” from the taskbar under “File” or by
clicking the button “Add Song” from Menu frame. After clicking this
button, a window is opened which directs the user to his file directory
where all the songs are stored and he can select a song accordingly.
This app also provides user with options: “Delete a song” to delete a
single song from the song queue, and “Delete all songs” to delete all
songs from the queue. This app also includes the “Exit” button for the
user to exit the party.
The song queue is displayed in the right frame under the title “Your
Song Queue”. This app also allows the user to control his music using
the following buttons:
1) Play – The middlemost play button is used to play songs after they
have been added into and selected from the song queue.
2) Pause – The pause button allows the user to pause a song and
continue playing it.
3) Forward – The forward button allows the user to jump to the next
song.
4) Backward – The backward button allows the user to jump to the

5) Stop – The stop button allows the user to stop the currently playing
song.
